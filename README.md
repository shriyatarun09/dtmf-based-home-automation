## DTMF Based Home Automation for Geriatric People (2020)

**Academic Project | B.Tech**

### Overview
This project focuses on designing a home automation system that enables elderly users to control household appliances remotely using mobile phones and DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Frequency) signaling.

### Problem Statement
Physical operation of switches can be inconvenient for elderly and physically challenged individuals. This system aims to provide a simple and accessible method to control home appliances remotely.

### Approach
- DTMF-based control using mobile phones
- Decoding DTMF signals using MT8870 decoder
- Microcontroller-based decision logic
- Relay-based switching of electrical appliances

### Technologies & Components
DTMF Decoder (MT8870), AT89C51 Microcontroller, Relays, Mobile Phone Interface, Embedded Systems

### Outcome
The system enables remote ON/OFF control of home appliances, improving accessibility, convenience, and energy efficiency for elderly users.

### Note
The original source code and hardware setup are not available. This repository contains the academic project documentation and report for reference.
